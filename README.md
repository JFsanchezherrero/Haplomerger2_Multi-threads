# Haplomerger2_Multi-threads
Multi thread implementation of Haplomerger2

HaploMerger2 (HM2) is an important upgrade over HaploMerger. Check the original Haplomerger2 details at: https://github.com/mapleforest/HaploMerger2


Here what I would try to do is to implement threads in some specific points where the process is triggering too much time.
